## Bio

I’m a PhD candidate in **computational cosmology** at the AstroParticule & Cosmology Laboratory (APC, **CNRS/IN2P3**) in Paris. I build **differentiable, distributed cosmological simulations** for **full-field weak-lensing inference**, with an eye toward **LSST** to constrain cosmological parameters.

I’m also part of the **Simons Observatory**, working on **CMB component separation**. I’m particularly interested in modeling the **spatial variability of foreground spectral indices** and using the **FURAX** framework to reduce bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio ***r*** in **full-sky** analyses.

I am also interested in combining **CMB** and **large-scale structure** datasets for **cross-survey** analyses to tighten constraints and improve systematics control.

My work sits at the interface of **cosmological modeling** and **high-performance computing**—distributing workloads with **JAX** and **NCCL**, and using modern **automatic differentiation** to build end-to-end differentiable models. Tools I lean on include **C++** and **CUDA**.

Before CNRS, I worked in industry at **Dassault Systèmes** as an infrastructure engineer on **CATIA** and **SOLIDWORKS**; earlier, I was a **data acquisition engineer** at **Renault**, focusing on **ADAS** sensor data collection and pipelines for algorithm development.
